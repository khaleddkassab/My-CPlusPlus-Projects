Implement a function called drawRectangle that draw a rectangular shape based on its given dimensions.
drawRectangle has the following parameters:
• L : length of the rectangle
• W : width of the rectangle
Constraints:
• Output shape should be printed using the alphabets as shown below.
• We need to keep the middle of the rectangle empty.
The function drawRectangle will call 2 functions to perform its task, the first is drawFirst_Last which is used to draw the first and last rows of the rectangle, and the second is drawMiddle which draws all of the intermediate lines. Both of drawFirst_Last & drawMiddle take width of the rectangle and the character to print as parameters.
