Zeller’s congruence is an algorithm developed by Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week. The formula is
ℎ=(𝑞+26(𝑚+1)10+𝑘+𝑘4+𝑗4+5𝑗)%7
where h is the day of the week (0: Saturday, 1: Sunday, 2: Monday, 3: Tuesday,
4: Wednesday, 5: Thursday, 6: Friday).
q is the day of the month.
m is the month (3: March, 4: April, . . . , 12: December). January and February
are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year.
j is the century.
k is the year of the century. (i.e., year % 100).
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a year, month, and day of the month, and displays the name of the day of the week. Here are some sample runs:
